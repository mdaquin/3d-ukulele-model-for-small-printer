# 3D ukulele model for small printer

An Open SCAD model of a ukulele in 4 parts that can be printed on the smallest 3d printer

This is a simple project for open SCAD of a playeable ukulele which can be printed in four separate parts, each fitting within a 12cmx12cmx12cm cube. You can watch the making and testing of this in a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVpGd0PeAJA).

## Printing

The OpenSCAD model has four main modules that can be shown separatly, experted into STL and printed. I printed it on a Monoprice Select Mini (v1) using Cura at a fine resolution, 20% filling and the appropriate support structures. It seems be going OK, although it would look better with a good sanding. The head in the image below is an old version which was too small.
