# 3D ukulele model for small printer

An Open SCAD model of a ukulele in 4 parts that can be printed on the smallest 3d printer.

This is a simple project for open SCAD of a playeable ukulele which can be printed in four separate parts, each fitting within a 12cmx12cmx12cm cube. You can watch the making and testing of this in a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVpGd0PeAJA).

## Printing

The OpenSCAD model has four main modules that can be shown separatly, exported into STL and printed. I printed it on a Monoprice Select Mini (v1) using Cura at a fine resolution, 20% filling and the appropriate support structures. It seems to be going OK, although it would look better with a good sanding. The head in the image below is an old version which was too small.

I printed with two different plastics, both PLAs from the same brand, but in different colours. It turns out that, especially on the big pieces, they don't shrink exactly in the same way, so the two parts of the body are not completely aligned. It also means that, in order for them to slot properly together, it needs a bit of gritting and sanding.

## Fitting the tuning pegs

The dimensions of the head of the ukulele were set to fit exactly those machine heads I got. The holes are 9mm in diameters, and they are set in a layout to minimise the required space (which is not great for tuning though).

## Putting on strings 

The strings go on like any other ukulele. Nothing special to it. However, since the tuning pegs are a bit too high compared to the neck, the strings did not stay in place and some made a terrible sound. I put an elastic bad arround the head just above the neck to push them down a bit, and that apparently worked.

## Making sure it stays put

The different parts have a bit of wiggle room where they slot together, and when the string are on and tighten, it tends to go all bendy. To avoid that, there are little bits of plastic at the back where a piece of string can be put and tighten to keep everything in its right place.
