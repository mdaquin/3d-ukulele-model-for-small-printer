# 3D ukulele model for small printer

An Open SCAD model of a ukulele in 4 parts that can be printed on the smallest 3d printer

This is a simple project for open SCAD of a playeable ukulele which can be printed in four separate parts, each fitting within a 12cmx12cmx12cm cube. You can watch the making and testing of this in a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVpGd0PeAJA).

## Printing

The OpenSCAD model has four main modules that can be shown separatly, experted into STL and printed. I printed it on a Monoprice Select Mini (v1) using Cura at a fine resolution, 20% filling and the appropriate support structures. It seems be going OK, although it would look better with a good sanding. The head in the image below is an old version which was too small.

I printed with two different plastics, both PLAs from the same brand, but in different colours. It turns out that, especially on the big pieces, they don't shrink exactly in the same way, so the two parts of the body are not completely aligned. It also means that, in order for them to slot properly together, it needs a bit of gritting and sanding.
